        Section VI below.) In addition to, and without limitation of, any other prohibited content or behavior that is

        sexual, ethnic or racial or other discriminating slurs, or material which contains no relevant or constructive
        content or which goes beyond profanity into obscenity or abhorrence. Nor shall users identify individuals in a
        negative or derogatory fashion, unless such individuals are the high ranking officials of a company or have
        otherwise been covered in the media. If you believe a message violates our member policies, please contact
        Secret Vault immediately at <a href="mailto:sandeep.rana011@gmail.com">sandeep.rana011@gmail.com</a> so that we
        may consider its editing or removal.</p>
    <p>By sending or transmitting to us any information, creative suggestions, ideas, notes, concepts, resumes, other
        employment-related information or any other materials (collectively, "Submitted Materials"), or by posting such
        Submitted Materials to any area of the Site, you (i) represent and warrant to us that you have the legal right

        otherwise, without compensation to the provider of the Submitted Materials.</p>
    <p>None of the Submitted Materials shall be subject to any obligation, whether of confidentiality, attribution, or
        otherwise, on our part and we shall not be liable for any use, display or disclosure of any Submitted
        Materials.</p>
    <p><strong>VI. Forums</strong></p>
    <p>The Forums are designed to help our visitors and Members obtain career and company information and discuss ways
        to make career decisions. This information on the Forums is sometimes provided by our staff and sometimes by
        other third party contributors, many of whom use anonymous screen names and are people not otherwise connected
        with Secret Vault. You should be aware that people may occasionally post messages or make statements in the
        Forums that are misleading, deceptive, wrong or otherwise objectionable. They may do this unintentionally, or
        even intentionally. Therefore, treat the other users of the Forums in the same way you would treat anyone you
        had met for the first time, because anyone can post to our Forums - no invitation is required.</p>
    <p>Secret Vault is not necessarily affiliated with or endorsed by the companies described or mentioned in the
        Forums. The opinions expressed in the Forums reflect solely the opinion(s) of the participants - our visitors
        and Members - and may not reflect the opinion(s) of Secret Vault. You acknowledge and agree that we have the
        right, but not the obligation, to monitor the Site and the Forums and the materials you and other visitors may
        transmit or post. We also have the right, but not the obligation, to alter or remove any such materials
        (including, without limitation, any posting to a Forum), or to delete portions of or entire posts which violate
        the above rules, messages or topics that are unrelated to the specific message board on which they are posted,
        and advertisements, recruiting or other commercial messages, and to disclose such materials and the
        circumstances surrounding their transmission to third parties in order to operate the Site properly; to protect
        ourselves, our sponsors, and our Members and visitors, and to comply with legal obligations or governmental
        requests. We may also impose limits on certain features of the Forums or restrict your access to part or all of
        the Forums without notice or penalty if we believe you are in breach of the guidelines set forth in this
        section, any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, any applicable law, or for any other reason without
        notice of liability.</p>
    <p><strong>VII. Job Postings</strong></p>
    <p>By using the online job posting feature of the Site (the "Job Board"), in addition to and without limitation of
        any other prohibited content or behavior that is prohibited hereunder (see the Code of Conduct above in Section
        I, for example) you also agree not to:</p>
    <p>1. Post any jobs in the Job Board or anywhere else on Site for any competitor of Secret Vault or post jobs or
        other content that contains links to any site competitive with this Site;</p>
    <p>2. Post jobs, information or content in the Job Board or anywhere else on Site that contains hyperlinks, "hidden"
        keywords or keywords that are irrelevant to the job or the posting or are otherwise misleading;</p>
    <p>3. Use any information or content accessible on or via the Job Board or elsewhere on the Site for any purpose
        other than as an employer seeking employees, including but not limited to selling or promoting any products or
        services;</p>
    <p>4. Post or submit to the Job Board or anywhere else on Site any incomplete, false, misleading or inaccurate
        biographical or other information, or any information or content which is not your own;</p>
    <p>5. Use any feature of the Job Board or the Site to send any unsolicited communications to any user of the Site
        (including by mail, email, phone calls, text messages or faxes) regarding promotions and/or advertising of
        products or services;</p>
    <p>6. Delete or revise any information or material posted by any other person or entity; or</p>
    <p>7. Aggregate, copy or duplicate in any manner any of the information or content available from the Job Board or
        anywhere else on Site, without our prior express written consent.</p>
    <p>As with the other Forums available on the Site, Secret Vault is under no obligation to monitor the information
        residing on or transmitted to the Job Board or Resume Database (which information also shall be considered
        "Submitted Materials," as such term is defined hereunder), however, you agree that Secret Vault reserves the
        right to modify, reject or eliminate any information residing on or transmitted to such areas of the Site, or
        terminate the account of any user of such areas, that Secret Vault believes, in its sole discretion, to be
        unacceptable or in violation of these terms and conditions.</p>
    <p><strong>VIII. Third Party Web Sites</strong></p>
    <p>You may be able to link from the Site to third party web sites and third party web sites may link to the Site
        ("Linked Sites"). You acknowledge and agree that we have no responsibility for the information, content,
        products, services, advertising, code or other materials which may or may not be provided by or through Linked
        Sites. Links to Linked Sites do not constitute an endorsement or sponsorship by us of such web sites or the
        information, content, products, services, advertising, code or other materials presented on or through such web
        sites. Any reliance on the contents of a Linked Site is done at your own risk and you assume all
        responsibilities and consequences resulting from such reliance.</p>
    <p><strong>IX. Claims of Copyright Infringement</strong></p>
    <p>The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the "DMCA") provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that
        material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith
        that materials hosted by Secret Vault infringe your copyright, you (or your agent) may send us a notice
        requesting that the material be removed, or access to it blocked. The notice must include the following
        information:</p>
    <p>o a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right
        that is allegedly infringed;</p>
    <p>o identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works located
        on the Site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works);</p>
    <p>o identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and
        information reasonably sufficient to allow Secret Vault to locate the material on the Site;</p>
    <p>o information reasonably sufficient to permit Secret Vault to contact you, such as name, address, telephone
        number, and, if available, email address;</p>
    <p>o a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner
        complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and</p>
    <p>o a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the
        complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly
        infringed.</p>
    <p>If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA
        permits you to send Secret Vault a counter-notice. Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current
        statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see <a href="http://www.loc.gov/copyright" target="_blank">http://www.loc.gov/copyright</a>
        for details. Notices and counter-notices with respect to the Site should be sent to Liz Clarke, ranaq.com
        Inc., 132 West 31st Street, 16th Floor, New York, NY 10001, (212) 366-4212 (telephone), (646) 349-9652 (fax), <a
                href="mailto:copyright@ranaq.com">copyright@ranaq.com</a>. We suggest that you consult your
        legal advisor before filing a notice or counter-notice. Also, be aware that there can be penalties for false
        claims under the DMCA.</p>
