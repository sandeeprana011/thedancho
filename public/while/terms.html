        <h2>Article 1: Scope&nbsp;</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The TOS define the rights and obligations of the parties when using the Application. They form the basis of
            the contractual relationship between the Member and WHILE.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>1.1 Conflicting Rules</b></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>These Terms of Service (TOS) determine the main rules of use for the Application. They are supplemented by
            additional policies – the <a href="http://www.ranaq.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>, the <a
                    href="http://www.ranaq.com/cookies">Cookies Use Policy</a> and the <a
                    href="http://www.ranaq.com/trust">Confidence Charter</a> – in order to provide the Member with
            clearer guidance on how to use the Application. In the event of a conflict between the various policies
            making the rules inaccessible, unintelligible and/or unpredictable, these TOS shall prevail over the Privacy
            Policy, the Cookies Use Policy and the Confidence Charter.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>1.2 Independence of Provisions</b></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Should any provision of these TOS be declared invalid or inapplicable due to the effects of a law, regulation
            or ruling by a court with relevant jurisdiction, the other provisions shall remain effective and in force,
            unless these TOS become distorted, or the obligations of the parties significantly thrown out of balance.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Article 2: Amendments to the TOS</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>2.1 Updates</b></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>WHILE reserves the right, unilaterally and at any time, to add to or amend these TOS as it sees fit or to
            terminate the Services.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Member will be informed of updates to the TOS via the Application and/or by email sent to the address
            provided by the Member. It is the Member’s responsibility to ensure that this email address is valid.</p>
        <p>It is the Member’s responsibility to carefully read the updated TOS and to be fully aware of any changes
            ensuing from said updates.</p>
        <p>Complete acceptance of the changes is implied by the Member’s continued use of the Application’s Services
            following the updates.</p>
        <p>Should the Member not agree with changes made to the TOS, he or she has the option to end the Services and
            delete his or her Account as per Article 15.3.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>2.2 Immediate Effect</b></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>All new versions of the TOS shall be effective immediately for all Members.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Article 3: Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>3.1 Governing Law</b></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>These TOS shall be governed by French law, exclusive of its conflict of laws rules. &nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>3.2 Dispute Resolution</b></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In the case of dispute, the Member agrees to contact WHILE directly in writing (by email or letter, to the
            email or postal address provided in article 16 hereof) prior to taking any judicial or extra-judicial
            action, in order to try and find an amicable settlement to this dispute.</p>
        <p>In the case of failure, the Member is informed that he or she may choose to have recourse to mediation, free
            of charge, and submit its dispute to the Online Dispute Resolution platform proposed by the European
            Commission, which may be accessed at the following address:&nbsp;<a
                    href="http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/">http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/</a>.</p>
        <p>Any challenge or dispute related to the formation, interpretation, performance or expiry of these TOS or in
            any connection therewith which has not been amicably settled shall be submitted to the relevant courts of
            Paris (France).</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Article 4: Registration</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>4.1 Application Download Options</b></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Application is available on the Apple and Google official download platforms. It can be downloaded
            free-of-charge from the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store, on iPhones running version iOS 10&nbsp;or
            higher, and Android Smartphones running version 5 or higher.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>4.2 Member’s Rights when Registering</b></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Provided that the required conditions for Member status are met, WHILE shall assign the Member a personal
            Account, which includes:</p>
        <p>• &nbsp; &nbsp;A profile page&nbsp;</p>
        <p>• &nbsp; &nbsp;An inbox</p>
        <p>• &nbsp; &nbsp;A “notifications” option</p>
        <p>A Member may only have one Account.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>4.3 Obligations of the Member when Registering</b></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Member must be over the age of 18, and must guarantee that all information provided when registering is
            true and up-to-date.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Registration can be done in two ways:</p>
        <p>- via the Facebook Connect: the social network enables WHILE to use the Member’s profile photo, first name,
            age calculated based on date of birth and interests in order to create a “profile” page.&nbsp; Consequently,
            the Member must check the accuracy of his or her Facebook&nbsp; information before registering with the
            Service.</p>
        <p>- via a cell phone number: in this case, no information on the Member may be automatically retrieved and it
            is his or her responsibility to supply personal information such as first and last name, sex, date of birth
            as well as other additional information if desired and one or more personal photos at the time of
            registration.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Upon registration, the Member accepts these TOS and the Privacy Policy and agrees to fulfill his or her
            obligations, and particularly those set out in the Member Code of Conduct defined in Article 8 of these
            TOS.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Article 5: Services and Features</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>5.1 Purpose of the Service</b></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>WHILE is an online dating application enabling Members to find, in the Application, people with whom they
            have crossed paths or may cross paths, and people in whom they may be interested based on their search
            preferences or profile activity. This Application is for personal and recreational use only.&nbsp;Each
            Member is free to talk to and form relationships with other Members in compliance with these TOS and the
            law.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Services offered by WHILE may in no case be likened to a counseling or marriage bureau service. Its sole
            aim is to facilitate virtual or real-life meet-ups through the Application between Members with mutual
            interests, according to their locations and preferences.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>5.2 Services for Members</b></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Some of WHILE’s services are available on the Application free of charge (apart from connection and

        <p>• Sending of Messages and voice messages when one has a Crush.</p>
        <p>• Calling each Crush once and for a limited duration only, using the Video Call feature.</p>

        <p>• Accessing suggested profiles.</p>
        <p>• Using the integrated music streaming platform.</p>
        <p>• Configuring his or her search criteria.</p>

        <p>• Deleting Messages and voice messages.</p>

            Premium subscription, the conditions of which are set out in article 9.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Article 6: Protection of Personal Data</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>WHILE is very concerned with the protection of your personal data and the respect of your privacy. We suggest
            that you read our Privacy Policy and our Confidence Charter carefully to better understand how we process
            your personal data, available by clicking on the following links:&nbsp;</p>
        <p>• <a href="https://www.ranaq.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a></p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Article 7: WHILE’s Obligations and Liability</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>7.1 Technical Resources and Security</b></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>WHILE agrees to provide the infrastructure and technical resources to provide a high-quality service to
            Members with an iPhone device running operating system version iOS 10&nbsp;or higher, an Android Smartphone
            running version 5 or higher.</p>
        <p>WHILE cannot be held liable for any operating fault on the Member’s device or for any compatibility issue
            between the Application and the device.</p>
        <p>In addition, every effort is made to ensure that the risks of fraudulent access to WHILE’s system are
            minimized.&nbsp; In this respect, WHILE uses a firewall or equipment located between the Internet and the
            company’s private network, in order to make its security more robust by filtering traffic to and from the
            internet. It is, however, impossible to fully guarantee the security of a network.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>WHILE is not responsible for any failures, interruptions or poor performance of the Member’s internet
            provider Services, or for any cause beyond WHILE’s control which might interrupt or have an adverse effect
            on access to WHILE Services.</p>
        <p>The Member must have access to a secure email account. If such a precaution is not taken, or even if it is,
            while this probability remains low, the Member’s Account may be vulnerable to fraud.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>WHILE shall also endeavor to avert Members of any exceptional risk of receiving spam Messages or Messages
            claiming to have been sent by WHILE. The Member must be attentive and vigilant in order to avoid being the
            victim of scams and report any of the above circumstances to WHILE by sending a letter or email to the
            address provided in Article 16 hereof.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>7.2 Illegal Conduct &nbsp;</b></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>WHILE and its partners cannot be held liable for actions by its Members which are illegal or which incur
            criminal penalties, including but not limited to:</p>
        <p>• All types of scams,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>• All activities of a commercial or professional nature,</p>
        <p>• Prostitution,</p>
        <p>• Identity theft,</p>
        <p>• An infringement of a third-party intellectual property right,</p>
        <p>• An infringement of personal rights, such as image rights and the respect of the right to privacy.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>7.3 Reporting and Community Moderation System</b></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As a hosting provider and pursuant to Article 6.I-7 of the French Trust in the Digital Economy Act of June
            21, 2004, WHILE has no legal obligation to monitor the content sent or stored via the Application.</p>
        <p>However, according to Article 6.I-3 of this law, as a hosting provider, WHILE must set up a reporting and
            community moderation system in order to report some unlawful, abusive and prejudicial content.</p>
        <p>In such case and after due verification by Customer Service, WHILE commits to promptly remove the said
            content.</p>
        <p>Pursuant to Article 6.I-5 of the French Trust in the Digital Economy Act: the knowledge of illicit content is
            deemed effective when the hosting provider is notified of following:</p>
        <p>• The notification date</p>
        <p>• The content transmitter’s identity</p>
        <p>• The description of the facts in contention (possibly with screen shots of the content)</p>
        <p>• As well as the reasons for which the content must be removed.</p>
        <p>WHILE has therefore equipped the Application with a reporting and community moderation system, allowing
            Members to report the content described in Article 6.I-7 of the French Trust in the Digital Economy Act if
            it constitutes apology for crimes against humanity, apology for and incitement to terrorism, incitement to
            racial hatred, incitement to hatred based on gender, sexual orientation or handicap and inter alia child
            pornography, incitement to violence against women and violation of human dignity.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Guided by an extremely strict professional ethic and refusing any association with violent or insulting
            Members as well as unlawful, abusive or prejudicial content, WHILE’s team takes this reporting procedure
            very seriously, which may also be implemented in the case of statements contrary to accepted social
            etiquette.</p>
        <p>Hence, when the content published by a Member is reported, including using the Vidéo Call feature,&nbsp;the
            transmitter’s account can be suspended or terminated according to the conditions set forth in Article 15.4.
            This decision is based on the proof given by the report’s author and is made in order to ensure the
            withdrawal of the content in compliance with WHILE’s legal obligations.</p>
        <p>The Member having originally published the reported content will be informed of such a decision to suspend or
            terminate the Account via the Application and/or by email at the address given.&nbsp; He or she will in no
            case be informed of the identity of the report’s author.</p>
        <p>Outside the scope of this reporting system, the Member can decide to block another Member whose conduct does
            not comply with the rules of etiquette in order to prevent any conversation with him or her (mutual
            prevention of access to Likes, Hellos, Messages and voice messages that have been sent in the past and of
            sending any messages in the future, or being alerted of the presence of a Member who has been blocked,
            particularly if they think this Member is bothering them in one way or another).&nbsp; This action is
            confidential and enables Members to control the Members with whom they want to keep in touch or not.
            &nbsp;</p>
        <p>This reporting system is accessible and operational:&nbsp;</p>
        <p>• On an iPhone: at the bottom right of the Member’s profile photo, and at the top right of the conversation
            with the Member in question;</p>
        <p>• On an Android Smartphone: at the bottom right of the Member’s profile photo, and at the top right of the
            conversation with the Member in question;</p>
        <p>Should content be published that was reported and that may be seen as a violation of law or regulations, the
            Member who is a victim of this content is encouraged to submit a complaint to the appropriate police
            authorities.</p>
        <p>The reporting system put in place by WHILE does not replace any complaint and judicial procedure against a
            Member who authored the reported content.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Any misuse of the community moderation system or any unjustified reporting of a Member shall be considered a
            breach of these TOS, and penalties may be imposed including Account suspension/termination, pursuant to
            Article 15.4 of the TOS, besides application of penalties pursuant to Article 6.I-4 of the French Trust in
            the Digital Economy Act or even legal proceedings, under which damages may have to be paid to victims.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>7.4 Duty of Caution</b></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Member is solely liable for checking the identity of the people with whom he or she wishes to arrange a
            “real-life” meet-up. WHILE may not be held liable for any problems whatsoever arising from a “real-life”
            meet-up.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Similarly, the Member is solely liable for checking the identity of the Crush with whom they may want to
            engage in a Video Call and organize a “virtual” meetup. WHILE may not be held liable for any incidents
            occurring during a “virtual” meetup.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>7.5 Group Events</b></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Any use of WHILE Services to organize a group meeting of its Members constitutes a misuse of the Service.
            This is why using the Application to plan or organize a demonstration in a public place is strictly
            prohibited. Should such a meeting take place, WHILE may not be held liable in the case of a public order
            offense or any damage caused by such meeting.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p><b>8.1 Duty of Fairness and Honesty when Registering</b></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In order to become a Member, all of the following conditions must be met:</p>
        <p>• Must be an adult as specified by French law (minimum of 18 years old on last birthday).</p>
        <p>• Must have honestly and truthfully filled out the Facebook profile information or directly in the
            Application in the case of registration via a cell phone number. The Member must have provided the first
            name, sex and date of birth shown in his or her personal information. Failing that, the Member agrees to
            correct any errors on his or her Facebook profile, and to activate syncing of information between his or her
            Facebook profile and his or her Account. At the same time, the Member agrees to provide a valid email
            address.</p>
        <p>• Must agree to regularly update the information provided when accessing his or her Account from the
            Application.</p>
        <p>• Must have read these TOS and have accepted them when confirming his or her registration.</p>
        <p>WHILE does not have a legal obligation or the technical resources to verify the identity and age of Members.
            However, in the event of any doubt or cause for suspicion, or following the use of the “report” feature by a
            third party pointing to identity theft or fictitious or incorrect information, WHILE shall conduct an
            investigation as quickly as possible and may correct the information provided where necessary without
            misrepresenting the Member’s profile.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>For the duration of the investigation, WHILE reserves the right to suspend the Account of any Member giving
            cause for suspicion as well as his or her access to the Application, and to conduct the necessary checks, in
            particular by asking him or her to send a copy of an official ID. The Member will be informed of the
            suspension of his or her Account via the application and/or by email to the address given by the Member
            pursuant to Article 15.4 hereof.</p>
        <p>Should the Member be unable to provide said proof, or in the case of a proven offense under these TOS, WHILE
            may terminate the Account of the Member in question in accordance with the conditions set out by Article
            15.4 hereof.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Member agrees to have only one single account. Failing that, WHILE may terminate the additional accounts,
            under the conditions described in article 15.4 hereof.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

            picture where your face can be recognized clearly,&nbsp;excluding photos and/or information in which third
            parties or items with no connection to the person or Member appear, such that WHILE reserves the right to
            delete, at its discretion, any photo and/or profile that does not meet these requirements.</p>
        <p>• Refrain from posting any confidential information about others such as financial data.</p>

            modesty and human dignity.</p>

        <p>(iv) to attempt to circumvent the feature’s safety measures or to use the feature for purposes other than the

            limited duration.</p>
        <p>• Refrain from using the feature other than in an interactive, instant way, or from making any fixed and/or
            animated recording of the Video Call using any media.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>8.3 Personal Use</b></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Member agrees to use the Application solely for personal use. The WHILE network must not be exploited for
            commercial, promotional, electoral or recruitment purposes. It is strictly prohibited to send Messages of a
            marketing and/or commercial nature and/or newsletters via the WHILE inbox, including but not limited to
            content, guidelines or hyperlinks to third-party sites or materials, particularly those of WHILE’s
            competitors.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>8.4 Member’s Liability</b></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Member is only liable for his or her own actions and for the data that he or she publishes via the
            Application.</p>
        <p>Should WHILE be held liable for any failure by the Member to comply with its obligations, the Member shall
            hold WHILE harmless against any conviction made against it regarding the Member’s infringement of the law or
            of these TOS.</p>
        <p>The Member may report unlawful content which violates French law or these TOS using the moderation tools
            provided by the Application in accordance with Article 7.3 hereof.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>8.5 Photos</b></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>All photos of a pornographic or exhibitionist nature, or which violate modesty and are generally offensive to
            moral values are strictly prohibited. The publication of such photos will be considered a serious offense
            which can lead to the suspension and/or termination of the Member’s Account, in addition to any other
            penalties that may be imposed by the courts.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>8.6 Real-life Meet-ups</b></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>WHILE advises Members who wish to arrange “real-life” meet-ups to be vigilant.&nbsp; Members are solely
            responsible for verifying the identity of those with whom they meet. “Real-life” meet-ups are arranged
            independently of WHILE and are the sole responsibility of Members. WHILE cannot be held liable for any acts
            or problems of any type which have been committed or caused by Members and/or former Members when such
            events occur following use of the Application.&nbsp; In this respect, one of the intended benefits of the
            WHILE messaging service, again to ensure that Members remain safe and free from harassment, is to enable
            Members to decide which people should be allowed to see their profiles and talk to them.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As regards the people with whom the Member has agreed to exchange Messages, it is recommended that Members do
            not too readily reveal information which is not included in the profile such as a phone number, address or
            surname.&nbsp; For safety reasons, WHILE strongly advises that real-life meetings be arranged only in busy
            public places or that a friend or relative be informed of the meeting and that Members disclose their
            contact information only after a reasonable period of time.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>8.7 Account Management</b></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Member must regularly consult his or her inbox and notifications, which WHILE will use inter alia to keep
            the Member updated on information pertaining to its Services. This information may also be sent to the
            Member’s email address obtained through Facebook Connect or directly provided by the member when registering
            with a cell phone number.</p>
        <p>The Member may access the Services of his or her Account by connecting to the Application using a
            confidential user name and password. The Member is solely responsible for his or her login information and
            must ensure that no third party may access them. In particular, the Member shall specifically hold WHILE
            harmless against any communication, use or declaration made using his or her Account.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>8.8 Equipment</b></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The cost of equipment (hardware or software) required to access the Services together with all other costs
            related thereto, including telecommunications costs, shall be borne solely by the Member.&nbsp; The Member
            is solely responsible for the hardware used to access the Service.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Article 9: Charged Services&nbsp;</h2>
        <p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
        <p><b>9.1 Purchase of Packs of Hellos and WHILE Premium Subscriptions</b></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Hellos cannot be purchased individually. They are available in Packs of multiple Hellos, at prices indicated
            in the Apple App Store, the Google Play Store.</p>
        <p>Members receive a free Pack of Hellos when registering with the Application.</p>
        <p>Each Member may also sign up for a WHILE Premium subscription at any time.</p>
        <p>Premium Members have access, in addition to free services, to additional services reserved for subscribers.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Subscription offers allow access to WHILE Premium for a period corresponding to that of your subscription.
            &nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>9.2 Purchase of Video Call Packs</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Members who have had a Crush can make their first Video Call for free, for a limited time only.</p>
        <p>Once this first and only free Video Call has been used, each Member can purchase Video Calls as part of a
            Pack of one or more Video Calls (credit to be used), based on the pricing conditions indicated in the Apple
            App Store and the Google Play Store.</p>
        <p>A missed call does not count as a used Video Call. However, a Video Call is deemed used as soon as the
            Members are in communication.</p>
        <p>Please note that Video Calls are limited in time: as soon as the Members are in communication, the Video
            Call’s remaining duration begins counting down.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>9.3</b>&nbsp;<b>Payment Terms</b></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Payment is due for the entire period of subscription at the time when the WHILE Premium contract is
            concluded.</p>
        <p>Payment is processed and managed by the Apple App Store or Google Play Store depending on your device.</p>
        <p><b>WHILE has no direct control over payment, exchange rate or transfer of funds nor on any possible fees
            inherent to these operations. Consequently, the Apple App Store and Google Play Store alone are liable for
            their payment terms and processes.</b></p>
        <p><b>This is why WHILE has no control over reimbursement of your purchase. Any requests related to payment must
            be sent to your Store.</b></p>
        <p>WHILE does not collect any banking information. Your bank details are collected and processed directly by
            Apple or Google and remain outside of WHILE’s control.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>9.4&nbsp;</b><b>Contract Term and Renewal of the WHILE Premium Subscription</b></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The contract for access to WHILE Premium takes effect obligatorily between the parties starting at the time
            of sign-up and for the entire subscription period chosen.</p>
        <p>Subscriptions are automatically renewed except in the case of termination by the Member via the Apple App
            Store or the Google Play Store, which have a feature that allows any subscription from application providers
            to be terminated 24 hours prior to the term of the previous subscription. Upon receipt of the payment made
            automatically to your Store, WHILE approves your purchase and updates your account by giving you access to
            WHILE Premium for a period corresponding to the amount charged.</p>
        <p>If you do not wish to use the default “automatic renewal” option, simply deactivate it by following the
            instructions in the following link: <a href="https://www.ranaq.com/fr/faq/articles/115005694469">https://www.ranaq.com/fr/faq/articles/115005694469</a>
        </p>
        <p>If you wish to circumvent this automatic renewal at the end of the subscription term set up by the Stores,
            you must deactivate it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>9.5</b>&nbsp;<b>Withdrawal Rights</b></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As specified in article 9.3&nbsp;of these TOS, payments are processed and managed entirely by the Apple App
            Store or the Google Play Store, such that the right of withdrawal, if applicable, must be exercised directly
            through the App Store or Google Play.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Consequently, when a Member decides to exercise this right to withdrawal, he or she must notify the Apple App

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In the event of breach of the TOS or a legal provision by the Member, WHILE has the right to terminate the
            contract, effective immediately and without prejudice. WHILE is not required to justify its decision to
            terminate to the Member.</p>
        <p>In all cases, no reimbursement will be made if the Member is a WHILE Premium subscriber or has purchased

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Hellos and/or Video Calls&nbsp;purchased or offered by WHILE may only be used for the term during which the
            Account remains active, in compliance with the TOS.&nbsp; In the event of early termination of the Account

            termination or deletion of the Member Account shall be permanently deleted from the Member Account, without
            compensation of any kind.</p>
        <p>A subsequent re-registration of the Member will not allow him or her to recover the lost Hellos and/video
            Calls.</p>
        <p>WHILE may offer Hellos and/or Video Calls&nbsp;to Members as part of its loyalty program or for a special
            event.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>10.2 Cumulative Offers</b></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Packs of Hellos or Packs of Video Calls are cumulative. The number of Hellos or Video Calls in each Pack
            purchased is added to the Hellos already in the Member’s Account.</p>
        <p>Packs of Hellos and/or Packs of Video Calls&nbsp;are also cumulative with subscriptions, meaning that they
            allow users to benefit from more Hellos and/or Video Calls&nbsp;than those to which Premium Members have
